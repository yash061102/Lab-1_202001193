1.Identifying Functional and nonfunctional requirements.

→ Functional Requirements: 

→ Login into system:
In the first place this system has a login page for members so with that page any member of that Library can access any books at any place.
→ Register new User:
Any user wants to join this library system so for that purpose the system has one more option for adding users.
→ Borrowing Book:
System also has the option to borrow books from the library and at the time of borrowing the system also provides one return date to the user.
→ get Book details:
System also contains all book details And if new books come in the library the system must update that book details.
→ make Book request:
If any user wants a book which is not present in the library, the user can make a request for that book and when the book arrives at the library at that time the system informs the user.
→ Extend Return date:
If User wants to Extend return date of the book, the system also has that functionality.
→ Return Book:
Users can return books by the system. This is one of the functions of the system.
→ Searching Book:
Users Can Search a book with search functionality. 

→ Non Functional Requirements:

→ Performance And Availability:
At the same time many Users should be able to access the system, And System must be available for any time.
→ Consistency:
System always is in a consistent state like if any user issues a book and so for another user system shows that the book is not available so the user can get an idea  it means one book is available for only User at one time.
→ Security:
This System is always accessed within Institute LAN connections; no one outside of this network is not able to access this system and also every user has its private id password for login so the system is secured.
And also this system is not storing any type of plain text.
→ Maintainability:
System is always maintainable.System administrators are able to make changes in book details if any new books arrive.
→ Scalability:
If the number of users increases, the system will not crash,the system will handle a large number of users. 
→ Design Constraint:
This system is developed with HTML 5 So this system is only compatible with that type of device and runs only on Intitute LAN.


2.Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

→ Scope:
→ Scope of this Application is which is useful for those who are not able to hear.
→ This Application uses Artificial Intelligence so which is the scope of this Application.
→ This system is one Android Application so we can use it on mobile phones and tablets so which is one more scope of this Application.

→ Functional Requirements:

→ This System can identify different sounds like cars,horns and give immediate alerts.
→ This Application does not require login because in critical condition Users are not able to login.
→ Input of this application is always by the voice so the application can identify which type of sound is this and give an alert accordingly.
→ Application also keeps track of all User activity.

→ Non Functional Requirement:

→ Security:
Application must secure no data licked data must be secured between user and application.
→ Performance:
Application should not be crashed at any critical condition. And also provide alerts in minimum time.
→ Easy to Use:
There is not more functionality in the application so users can access the application very easily.
→ Scalability:
At the same time, many users are able to access the application without any difficulty or delay.
